# Green-Grocery
## A Full Stack Development Project using MERN Stack.

## Problem Motivation
- In these present situations, it is difficult for farmers to sell their products at a fair price in markets. Customers are buying hybrid fruits and vegetables which are not good for health which contain harmful substances.
- Customers are buying products at a higher price than the market price.

## Problem Statement
Farmers can sell fruits, vegetables, and dairy products at fair market prices on our website and customers can buy directly organic products from farmers through the website which are fresh and healthy for the body.
 
## Problem Solution
- Farmers can sell fruits, vegetables, and dairy products at fair market prices on our website
- Customers can buy directly organic products from farmers through the website which are fresh and healthy for the body

## Project Overall Idea
- Farmers can contact the GreenGrocery website and can sell their vegetables, fruits, and dairy products at fair prices.
- The process includes, firstly, the delivery guy picks their products and the management staff is responsible for
updating these products on the website.
- Users can log in to the website and can buy organic fruits, vegetables, and dairy products which are very fresh and healthy that come directly from farmers.
- Users can then select their required products and the respective quantity of each product and add them to the cart. After adding to the cart, the user can checkout and fill in the shipping details, and enter payment details.
- After a successful transaction, the user will get an order confirmation and a tracking link. Users can resolve their queries in the Contact Us section.
